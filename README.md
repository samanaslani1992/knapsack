# Knapsack problem

In this project, I have used the backpack algorithm in the greedy way.

[Knapsack problem.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem)

The algorithm of Greedy quickly and can also be optimal in some cases. However, in some special cases,
it does not give the optimal solution.
